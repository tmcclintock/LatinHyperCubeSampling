# LatinHyperCubeSampling

This repository is for a yet to be written article about using a Latin
hypercube for randomly sampling hyperparameters in a deep learning setting. This
is advantageous over a grid for scaling reasons, and is better than purely
random sampling since that is not space filling.

## Requirements

You can install the requirements for performing the experiments here with the
`requirements.txt` file as follows (I recommend you do so in an [`anaconda`
environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
